GW2Tools
=========

This project is a site which use at low level code the "GW2 api client" I wrote.

It allow you to see stuff about your Guildwars 2 account : 

- characters
- equipments
- bank
- wallet
- ...

I have not the time to make a tutorial to explain you how to host yourself this project.

You can contact me at arnaud@arnapou.net for clever questions (I won't learn you PHP, storage, caching system, and so on ...) if you don't understand something I wrote.
