GW2Tools
=========

This project is a site which use at low level code the "GW2 api client" I wrote.

It allow you to see stuff about your Guildwars 2 account : 

- characters
- equipments
- bank
- wallet
- ...

I have not the time to make a tutorial to explain you how to host yourself this project.


### Disclaimer

In January 2019, I had a problem in game and I contacted the support, they were so bad and stupid that they 
worsened the ticket. 

I gave up once and for all with the Guildwars licence after more than 13 years of time spent in this amazing world.

Note that I always love the lore and the design of the world, but I won't spend time and gave money anymore to 
the editor.

I killed the website gw2tool.net I hosted for several years, you are free to host yourself an instance.

It was a rare open source tool for Guildwars on the community but I had no contribution for 4 years so I guess 
the repository is dead forever.
